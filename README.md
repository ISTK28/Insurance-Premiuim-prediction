Dataset
The dataset, Medicalpremium.csv, contains information on the following attributes:

Age: Age of the individual
Diabetes: Presence of diabetes (1 for Yes, 0 for No)
BloodPressureProblems: Presence of blood pressure problems (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

Build and evaluate predictive models.

Data Exploration:

Inspect the structure and summary of the dataset.
Identify missing values and clean data.
Visualization:

Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
Explore feature correlations and distribution.
Modeling (if implemented):

Apply regression models to predict PremiumPrice.
